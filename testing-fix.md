# Testing fix (update from github) (update to double slash //)
The input is a collection of \\(N\\) numbers and iteration k. 
At each iteration, we need pick the largest number \\(x\\), put \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) back to the collection, and take away \\(x-\\sqrt{x}\\). 
The output is sum of remaining numbers after \\(k\\) iterations.

## With single slash (new)

The input is a collection of \(N\) numbers and iteration k. At each iteration, we need pick the largest number \(x\), put \(\sqrt{x}\) back to the collection, and take away \(x-\sqrt{x}\) . The output is sum of remaining numbers after \(k\) iterations.
